PyBryt Documentation
====================

PyBryt is an open source  Python auto-assessment library for teaching and learning. Our goal is to empower students and educators to learn about technology through fun, guided, hands-on content aimed at specific learning goals. PyBryt is designed to work with existing autograding solutions and workflows such as `Otter Grader`_, `OkPy`_, and `Autolab`_.

Educators and institutions can leverage PyBryt to integrate auto-assessment and reference models to hands-on labs and assessments.

- Educators do not have to enforce the structure of the solution
- Learners practice the design process, code design, and solution implementation
- Meaningful pedagogical feedback to the learners
- Analysis of complexity within the learner's solution
- Plagiarism detection and support for reference implementations
- Easy integration into existing organizational or institutional grading infrastructure
